# Let's use decorators to build a name directory! You are given some information about N people. Each person has a first name, last name, age and sex. 
# Print their names in a specific format sorted by their age in ascending order i.e. the youngest person's name should be printed first. For two people of the same age, 
# print them in the order of their input.
# For Henry Davids, the output should be:
# Mr. Henry Davids
# For Mary George, the output should be:
# Ms. Mary George
# Sample Input
# 3
# Mike Thomson 20 M
# Robert Bustle 32 M
# Andria Bustle 30 F
# Sample Output
# Mr. Mike Thomson
# Ms. Andria Bustle
# Mr. Robert Bustle
# Concept
# For sorting a nested list based on some parameter, you can use the itemgetter library. You can read more about it here.
