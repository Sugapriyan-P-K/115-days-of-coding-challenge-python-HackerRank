# Task
# Given 2 sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in ascending order. The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either M or 
# N but do not exist in both.
# Sample Input
# STDIN       Function
# -----       --------
# 4           set a size M = 4
# 2 4 5 9     a = {2, 4, 5, 9}
# 4           set b size N = 4
# 2 4 11 12   b = {2, 4, 11, 12}
# Sample Output
# 5
# 9
# 11
# 12
